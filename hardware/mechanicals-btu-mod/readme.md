## Description

This is @keyboard-magpie 's modification of the top shell of the ploopy thumb trackball to convert it to use ball-transfer-units.

This design is intended to be compatable with the standard baseplate file. 

The modification also includes a 5 degree tilt base file with small cutouts for different BTUs. STEP files for further editing are included also.
